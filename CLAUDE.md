# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

For execution flow maps, module responsibility matrix, account type locations, and SDK↔program mappings, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Package Manager

Use `bun` (not yarn/npm) for JavaScript/TypeScript dependency management: `bun install`, `bun run <script>`.

## Build

**M1/Apple Silicon:** Always use an x86_64 cross-compile toolchain — never a native aarch64 toolchain. Native ARM toolchains break memory layout expectations for zero-copy accounts, which must match the on-chain (x86_64) representation.

- Anchor 0.29.x branches: `rustup default 1.76.0-x86_64-apple-darwin`
- Anchor 1.0 branches: `rustup default stable-x86_64-apple-darwin`

**Rust version and zero-copy struct alignment:** Rust ≥ 1.77 corrected `align_of::<u128>()` to 16 bytes on x86_64; the on-chain SBF target has always kept it at 8 bytes. All zero-copy structs in this repo are explicitly padded so `(SIZE - 8) % 16 == 0` and u128/i128 fields are ordered before any `PoolBalance` fields — this makes `sizeof` identical on all targets regardless of Rust version. You must still develop and test with Rust ≥ 1.77 so that x86_64 exercises real 16-byte u128 alignment and any future struct change that breaks the invariant is caught locally (the `const_assert_eq!` guards fire) rather than silently diverging on-chain. The minimum for Anchor 1.0 branches is Rust ≥ 1.89 (Anchor 1.0 MSRV). See [`docs/alignment-and-native-offsets.md`](./docs/alignment-and-native-offsets.md) for the full invariant rules and guidance on adding fields to zero-copy structs.

**Solana programs (Rust/Anchor):**
```bash
anchor build
# With anchor-test feature (required for TS integration tests):
anchor build -- --features anchor-test
```

**SDK:**
```bash
cd sdk/ && bun install && bun run build
```

**Update IDL after program changes:**
```bash
anchor build -- --features anchor-test && cp target/idl/drift.json sdk/src/idl/drift.json
```

## Testing

**Rust unit tests:**
```bash
cargo test -p drift                    # drift program only
cargo test -p drift -- --show-output  # with stdout
```

**Single TypeScript integration test:**
```bash
ts-mocha -t 300000 ./tests/<test_file>.ts
```

**Full TypeScript integration test suite** (builds first, then runs all ~70 test files serially):
```bash
bash test-scripts/run-anchor-tests.sh
# Skip rebuild if .so is already built:
bash test-scripts/run-anchor-tests.sh --skip-build
```

**SDK unit tests:**
```bash
cd sdk/ && bun run test:dlob    # DLOB tests
cd sdk/ && bun run test:ci      # CI subset
```

**Lint/format:**
```bash
cargo fmt                        # Rust
cd sdk/ && yarn prettify:fix     # SDK (TypeScript)
```

## Architecture

This is **Drift Protocol v2** — a Solana perpetuals and spot trading protocol.

### Programs (`programs/`)
- **`drift/`** — Core protocol (Anchor, ~500k+ lines of Rust). Entry point: `src/lib.rs`. Main instruction handlers in `src/instructions/`:
  - `user.rs` — trading instructions (place/cancel/fill orders)
  - `keeper.rs` — keeper/crank instructions (settle PnL, funding, liquidations)
  - `admin.rs` — admin/governance instructions
  - `lp_pool.rs`, `lp_admin.rs` — LP pool management
- **`pyth/`, `pyth-lazer/`, `switchboard/`, `switchboard-on-demand/`** — Oracle stubs/integrations (minimal, mostly `no-entrypoint` wrappers)
- **`openbook_v2/`, `token_faucet/`** — DEX integration and test utilities

### SDK (`sdk/`)
TypeScript library (`@drift-labs/sdk`). Key modules in `src/`:
- `driftClient.ts` — main client class
- `user.ts` — user account abstraction
- `dlob/` — Decentralized Limit Order Book implementation
- `math/` — pricing, margin, funding math
- `idl/drift.json` — generated Anchor IDL (do not edit manually)

### Tests (`tests/`)
~70 TypeScript integration tests using ts-mocha + Anchor's local validator (bankrun for some). Each test spins up a local validator with the program deployed. Tests are run serially by `run-anchor-tests.sh`.

### Program internals
- `programs/drift/src/math/` — core math (funding, fees, margin, AMM)
- `programs/drift/src/state/` — account structs (User, PerpMarket, SpotMarket, etc.)
- `programs/drift/src/controller/` — stateful operations (position updates, fills, liquidations)
- `programs/drift/src/validation/` — pre-instruction validation

### Doc comments

All modules have doc comments. When making feature or refactor changes, update any module-level doc comments that would be invalidated by the change.

### Error enum stability

The drift program's `Error` enum is ABI-stable — on-chain clients identify errors by numeric code. When modifying it:
- **Add** new variants at the **bottom** only, never insert between existing ones.
- **Remove** by marking the variant as deprecated (e.g., `/// @deprecated`) and leaving it in place — do not delete or reorder.

### Key design patterns
- Drift uses a custom native entrypoint (discriminator `[0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, opcode]`) for high-frequency keeper instructions that bypass Anchor overhead, alongside the standard Anchor `#[program]` entrypoint.
- `remaining_accounts` is used extensively to pass variable numbers of oracle accounts, spot markets, and maker accounts to instructions.
- Zero-copy account loading (`AccountLoader`) is used for large accounts (User, PerpMarket).
- Feature flags: `mainnet-beta` (production gates), `anchor-test` (enables test helpers), `no-entrypoint`/`cpi` (for SDK dependencies).
